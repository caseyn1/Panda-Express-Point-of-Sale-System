Minutes From the Sprint planning meeting:

In the planning meeting we discussed the plan of attack for this project. We created an initial backlog for the project and layed out the goals we would have for the first sprint. We chose that for the first sprint in order to learn the dev stack and produce a mvp we would just recreate the checkout view and choose the items in the backlog that pertained to this. We also decided that since Siddarth has a lot of experience with this dev stack we would have him help members of both the backend and front end teams get started and comfortable with their parts.

Minutes From the Sprint Retrospective meeting:

In the retrospective meeting we looked over what was did in Sprint 1. Most of us realized a large portion of the time was spent learning the new languages in the development stack. We then realized how in the first Sprint we all tackled the same view, but going forward we will all be working on our own respective views. We also concluded that through having the sprint meetings our communication improved drastically as a team compared to our first project together. Because we like this improvement so much, we decided to add a 4th daily meeting into the next sprint to see if that continues to improve communication among members. We recognized that we were often confused about some guidelines and for the sprint and next sprint we want to make sure we completely understand everything that is tasked to us. We decided that it would be beneficial to reread all the materials individually and ask any question immediately to either the group or the instructors/TAs. The last thing that we talked about at the meeting was keeping a partner for our coding process to review our code at least every 3 days. We decided to break into three groups one frontend and one backed developer per pair. This was to ensure that we were using best practices in both our frontend and backend code throughout the entire project. Overall, we were satisfied at this meeting as everything in sprint 1 had been completed and we recognized we were ready for the large undertaking of sprint 2.

November 4, 2024 4:10pm - 17 minutes
In the sprint 2 planning meeting we started of by just recapping everything that had been done to this point in the project. We then sat down and outlined what we felt our biggest remaining hurdles were and what was the remaining work left on the project. We decided that everyone would work on their own view Casey - Kitchen View, Matthew - Kiosk View, John - Menu Board, Sid - Continuing cashier view, Julius - Manager view, and Cayden had elements on both kiosk view and manager view to improve the quality of the project. We decided that the biggest hurdle would be getting the project hosted and constant communication between views. Lastly we assigned tasks from the backlog to their individuals at the end of the meeting.

November 6, 2024 4:10pm - 15 minutes

We officially started the sprint and saw the progress on the product from the last meeting. Casey and Matthew discussed how they were having roadblocks connecting their pages and they decided that they would collaborate and figure out how to fix this before the next meeting. John explained that he set up the weather api on the menu board. Julius and Cayden both discussed how they worked on some functionality on the manager view, but were only able to just get started. Siddarth discussed how he was unable to get the project hosted using Heroku and how he is researching the other options Casey heard in the scrum meeting. Lastly we reviewed the backlog and made sure we were on task.

November 8, 2024 11:30am - 12 minutes
We discussed and shared the link for the hosted project which is on render. Everyone said that their progress had been minimal; the only other updates since the last meeting was that Matthew had a functioning kiosk view for the product. This functioning kiosk still didn’t 100% agree with the kitchen view so we decided that we would add another table to the database later to combat this. We looked at the remaining task on the back log.

November 11, 2024 4:10pm -15 minutes
We discussed and showed the features that we worked on over the weekend. We had a fully functional kitchen and kiosk view now. We showed these products and discussed design changes to make them easier to read/ more user friendly. We discussed that we should add an index page to easily find all of the views. We looked at the manager page and discussed potential design additions to the page. We also talked about how we wanted our review system to work with us predominantly only having a five star rating system.

November 12,2024 12:00pm - 13 minutes
In this meeting we discussed what was left on the backlog for the sprint and decided what to prioritize for completion. We thought it would be vital to have the index page. We discussed what testing methods we had implemented for our views. Lastly we reviewed the challenges we were still having with o-auth. We also discussed potential additional problems that could be addressed to take the project above and beyond.

November 18, 2024 12:00pm  - 18 minutes
In the sprint retrospective meeting we discussed all that we were able to accomplish this sprint, the future outlook of the project as we start making our way into sprint 3, as well as what struggles we faced as a team. We went through our MVP and saw that we had an almost fully functional product with the bare minimum requirement for the project, the five views and the two of the three needed api’s. We realized that our product was very polished for where we are at now, although we faced many challenges with database communication and hosting our project originally. We think during this sprint communication went very right and nothing went overly wrong because our communication allowed us to prevail.  We decided that for the next sprint we would just have three regular meetings as we want to spend more time polishing and refining the project. Some adjustments that we found needed to be made were in the area of testing. Although each of us may have had very basic testing capabilities for our code none of us had nearly as much as we would like to prove that the code worked flawlessly. We had to move two items to the next sprint because we underestimated how long it would take to complete the prerequisites for these two features. Overall we were much happier with this sprint than the previous one and we felt that our product was in a very good position in relation to sprint 3.


November 19, 2024 - 16 Minutes
In the sprint planning meeting we discussed where we were currently in the project. We realized that most everything was roughly complete and working. We knew that the remaining hurdles would be implementing extra functionality to improve the user experience. We decided that some UI design changes needed to be implemented. We discussed new items we wanted to add to the sprint backlog for the final sprint, but ultimately realized that we needed to ensure that all of our testing for the software was written or created to ensure the MVP works as anticipated. We also discussed the need to review the ADA and ensure our product was compliant.


November 20, 2024 -13 Minutes
Casey and Matthew discussed the code review they completed together to ensure that the Kitchen/Kiosk views were completely in sync and met the needs of the user stories. Julius, Cayden and John discussed what was left in the manager view and how John was adding to the services tab. Siddarth explained the initial difficulty with the translate api, but told us it was now completely up and running.


November 22, 2024 - 14 minutes
We reviewed what was said in the scrum master meeting by other teams to ensure that we were on par with our peers. We then evaluated the progress of our project over the last 3 days. We realized that nothing had been overly successful, just that we were busy in other classes. We did find added features the site needed such as a completed orders tab and allergen information for the food products. We also discussed the bugs we had in the current o-auth implementation and Siddarth said he would try to fix them over the weekend.


November 25, 2024 - 15 minutes
Casey showed us the new completed orders view. John showed the redesigned menu board to fit the requirements addressed in the scrum meeting on friday. Matthew showed how he enlarged the kiosk view so that it would be easier for customers to use. Julius told us how he had to change the existing file structure to reduce warnings in the existing code. Cayden told us of his progress on the customer rewards system, but was not yet finished as this was a massive undertaking. Siddarth explained how he started writing test cases for his software and was ready to start code review.
